# Interstitial Ad

Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of an app until closed by the user. They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game. When an app shows an interstitial ad, the user has the choice to either tap on the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app.

```js
const AdMob = require('ti.admob');
AdMob.initialize({ 'appId': 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511' });
const interstitial = AdMob.createInterstitialAd({
  adUnitId: 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/4411468910'
});
interstitial.load();

// ... later in your app when you plan to display the interstitial
if (interstitial.isReady) {
  interstitial.show();
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Don't use the `load` event to show the interstitial. This can cause a poor user experience. Instead, pre-load the ad before you need to show it. Then check the `isReady` flag on the interstitial to find out if it is ready to be shown.
