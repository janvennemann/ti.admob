# Banner Ad View

Banner ads are rectangular image or text ads that occupy a spot within an app's layout. They stay on screen while users are interacting with the app, and can refresh automatically after a certain period of time. If you're new to mobile advertising, they're a great place to start.

```js
const AdMob = require('ti.admob');
AdMob.initialize({ 'appId': 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511' });
const win = Ti.UI.createWindow();
const bannerView = AdMob.createBannerView({
  adUnitId: 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716',
  bottom: 0,
  height: 50
});
bannerView.load();
win.add(bannerView);
win.open();
```

## Properties

## Parity Info

- Android: `loadAd` and `requestAd` need to be replaced by `load`
- Android: All properties except for `adUnitId` and `adSize` can be removed. Ad request customization is done via `load(options)`.

## Changed

- Ad will now be loaded via `load` and options can be passed for each load request.
- Ad size can be specified via the new `AdSize` proxy.
- Renamed events to be more JS'ish
